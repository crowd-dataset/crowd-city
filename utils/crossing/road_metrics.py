"""Crossing metrics measured against the segmented carriageway.

The baseline metrics infer both quantities from bounding-box motion alone: the
hesitation time is the leading run of near-stationary samples in a track, and
the speed is fitted over the whole track. Neither knows where the kerb is.

Here the road-surface timeline supplies that boundary. The hesitation time
becomes the stationary interval immediately before the pedestrian steps onto
the carriageway, and the speed is fitted only over the frames spent on it.
Everything else, including the frozen Waymo speed model, is unchanged, so the
two sets of values stay directly comparable.
